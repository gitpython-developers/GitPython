Changelog
=========

4.0.0
=====

GitPython will no longer throw an ImportError when no git executable can
be found at import time. Instead, errors are deferred until the first
attempt at using it. Consumers with special handling for
the old ImportError behaviour should instead call `git.refresh` and handle
GitCommandNotFoundErrors themselves.

* Fix incorrect `requirements.txt` which could lead to broken installations, see this `issue <https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/908>`__ for details.

3.0.0 - Remove Python 2 support
===============================

Motivation for this is a patch which improves unicode handling when dealing with filesystem paths.
Python 2 compatibility was introduced to deal with differences, and I thought it would be a good idea
to 'just' drop support right now, mere 5 months away from the official maintenance stop of python 2.7.

The underlying motivation clearly is my anger when thinking python and unicode, which was a hassle from the
start, at least in a codebase as old as GitPython, which totally doesn't handle encodings correctly in many cases.

Having migrated to using `Rust` exclusively for tooling, I still see that correct handling of encodings isn't entirely
trivial, but at least `Rust` makes clear what has to be done at compile time, allowing to write software that is pretty
much guaranteed to work once it compiles.

Again, my apologies if removing Python 2 support caused inconveniences, please see release 2.1.13 which returns it.

2.1.14
======

* Fixed handling of 0 when transforming kwargs into Git command arguments
  (Backported from `#899 <https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/899>`_)

2.1.0 - Much better windows support!
====================================

Special thanks to @ankostis, who made this release possible (nearly) single-handedly.
GitPython is run by its users, and their PRs make all the difference, they keep
GitPython relevant. Thank you all so much for contributing !

Notable fixes
-------------

* The `GIT_DIR` environment variable does not override the `path` argument when
  initializing a `Repo` object anymore. However, if said `path` unset, `GIT_DIR`
  will be used to fill the void.

https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22v2.1.0+-+proper+windows+support%22


2.0.9 - Bugfixes
=============================

* `tag.commit` will now resolve commits deeply.
* `Repo` objects can now be pickled, which helps with multi-processing.
* `Head.checkout()` now deals with detached heads, which is when it will return
  the `HEAD` reference instead.

* `DiffIndex.iter_change_type(...)` produces better results when diffing

2.0.8 - Features and Bugfixes
=============================

* `DiffIndex.iter_change_type(...)` produces better results when diffing
  an index against the working tree.
* `Repo().is_dirty(...)` now supports the `path` parameter, to specify a single
  path by which to filter the output. Similar to `git status <path>`
* Symbolic refs created by this library will now be written with a newline
  character, which was previously missing.
* `blame()` now properly preserves multi-line commit messages.
* No longer corrupt ref-logs by writing multi-line comments into them.

2.0.7 - New Features
====================

* `IndexFile.commit(...,skip_hooks=False)` added. This parameter emulates the
   behaviour of `--no-verify` on the command-line.

2.0.6 - Fixes and Features
==========================

* Fix: remote output parser now correctly matches refs with non-ASCII
  chars in them
* API: Diffs now have `a_rawpath`, `b_rawpath`, `raw_rename_from`,
  `raw_rename_to` properties, which are the raw-bytes equivalents of their
  unicode path counterparts.
* Fix: TypeError about passing keyword argument to string decode() on
  Python 2.6.
* Feature: `setUrl API on Remotes <https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/446#issuecomment-224670539>`__

2.0.5 - Fixes
=============

* Fix: parser of fetch info lines choked on some legitimate lines

2.0.4 - Fixes
=============

* Fix: parser of commit object data is now robust against cases where
  commit object contains invalid bytes.  The invalid characters are now
  replaced rather than choked on.
* Fix: non-ASCII paths are now properly decoded and returned in
  ``.diff()`` output
* Fix: `RemoteProgress` will now strip the ', ' prefix or suffix from messages.
* API: Remote.[fetch|push|pull](...) methods now allow the ``progress`` argument to
  be a callable. This saves you from creating a custom type with usually just one
  implemented method.

2.0.3 - Fixes
=============

* Fix: bug in ``git-blame --incremental`` output parser that broken when
  commit messages contained ``\r`` characters
* Fix: progress handler exceptions are not caught anymore, which would usually just hide bugs
  previously.
* Fix: The `Git.execute` method will now redirect `stdout` to `devnull` if `with_stdout` is false,
  which is the intended behaviour based on the parameter's documentation.

2.0.2 - Fixes
=============

* Fix: source package does not include \*.pyc files
* Fix: source package does include doc sources

2.0.1 - Fixes
=============

* Fix: remote output parser now correctly matches refs with "@" in them

2.0.0 - Features
================

Please note that due to breaking changes, we have to increase the major version.

* **IMPORTANT**: This release drops support for python 2.6, which is
  officially deprecated by the python maintainers.
* **CRITICAL**: `Diff` objects created with patch output will now not carry
  the --- and +++ header lines anymore.  All diffs now start with the
  @@ header line directly.  Users that rely on the old behaviour can now
  (reliably) read this information from the a_path and b_path properties
  without having to parse these lines manually.
* `Commit` now has extra properties `authored_datetime` and
  `committer_datetime` (to get Python datetime instances rather than
  timestamps)
* `Commit.diff()` now supports diffing the root commit via
  `Commit.diff(NULL_TREE)`.
* `Repo.blame()` now respects `incremental=True`, supporting incremental
  blames.  Incremental blames are slightly faster since they don't include
  the file's contents in them.
* Fix: `Diff` objects created with patch output will now have their
  `a_path` and `b_path` properties parsed out correctly.  Previously, some
  values may have been populated incorrectly when a file was added or
  deleted.
* Fix: diff parsing issues with paths that contain "unsafe" chars, like
  spaces, tabs, backslashes, etc.

1.0.2 - Fixes
=============

* IMPORTANT: Changed default object database of `Repo` objects to `GitCmdObjectDB`. The pure-python implementation
  used previously usually fails to release its resources (i.e. file handles), which can lead to problems when working
  with large repositories.
* CRITICAL: fixed incorrect `Commit` object serialization when authored or commit date had timezones which were not
  divisiblej by 3600 seconds. This would happen if the timezone was something like `+0530` for instance.
* A list of all additional fixes can be found `on GitHub <https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues?q=milestone%3A%22v1.0.2+-+Fixes%22+is%3Aclosed>`__
* CRITICAL: `Tree.cache` was removed without replacement. It is technically impossible to change individual trees and expect their serialization results to be consistent with what *git* expects. Instead, use the `IndexFile` facilities to adjust the content of the staging area, and write it out to the respective tree objects using `IndexFile.write_tree()` instead.

1.0.1 - Fixes
=============

* A list of all issues can be found `on GitHub <https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues?q=milestone%3A%22v1.0.1+-+Fixes%22+is%3Aclosed>`__

1.0.0 - Notes
=============

This version is equivalent to v0.3.7, but finally acknowledges that GitPython is stable and production ready.

It follows the `semantic version scheme <http://semver.org>`_, and thus will not break its existing API unless it goes 2.0.

0.3.7 - Fixes
=============
* `IndexFile.add()` will now write the index without any extension data by default. However, you may override this behaviour with the new `write_extension_data` keyword argument.

  - Renamed `ignore_tree_extension_data` keyword argument in `IndexFile.write(...)` to `ignore_extension_data`
* If the git command executed during `Remote.push(...)|fetch(...)` returns with an non-zero exit code and GitPython didn't
  obtain any head-information, the corresponding `GitCommandError` will be raised. This may break previous code which expected
  these operations to never raise. However, that behaviour is undesirable as it would effectively hide the fact that there
  was an error. See `this issue <https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/271>`__ for more information.

* If the git executable can't be found in the PATH or at the path provided by `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE`, this is made
  obvious by throwing `GitCommandNotFound`, both on unix and on windows.

  - Those who support **GUI on windows** will now have to set `git.Git.USE_SHELL = True` to get the previous behaviour.

* A list of all issues can be found `on GitHub <https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues?q=milestone%3A%22v0.3.7+-+Fixes%22+is%3Aclosed>`__


0.3.6 - Features
================
* **DOCS**

  * special members like `__init__` are now listed in the API documentation
  * tutorial section was revised entirely, more advanced examples were added.

* **POSSIBLY BREAKING CHANGES**

  * As `rev_parse` will now throw `BadName` as well as `BadObject`, client code will have to catch both exception types.
  * Repo.working_tree_dir now returns None if it is bare. Previously it raised AssertionError.
  * IndexFile.add() previously raised AssertionError when paths where used with bare repository, now it raises InvalidGitRepositoryError

* Added `Repo.merge_base()` implementation. See the `respective issue on GitHub <https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/169>`__
* `[include]` sections in git configuration files are now respected
* Added `GitConfigParser.rename_section()`
* Added `Submodule.rename()`
* A list of all issues can be found `on GitHub <https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues?q=milestone%3A%22v0.3.6+-+Features%22+>`__

0.3.5 - Bugfixes
================
* push/pull/fetch operations will not block anymore
* diff() can now properly detect renames, both in patch and raw format. Previously it only worked when create_patch was True.
* repo.odb.update_cache() is now called automatically after fetch and pull operations. In case you did that in your own code, you might want to remove your line to prevent a double-update that causes unnecessary IO.
* `Repo(path)` will not automatically search upstream anymore and find any git directory on its way up. If you need that behaviour, you can turn it back on using the new `search_parent_directories=True` flag when constructing a `Repo` object.
* IndexFile.commit() now runs the `pre-commit` and `post-commit` hooks. Verified to be working on posix systems only.
* A list of all fixed issues can be found here: https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues?q=milestone%3A%22v0.3.5+-+bugfixes%22+

0.3.4 - Python 3 Support
========================
* Internally, hexadecimal SHA1 are treated as ascii encoded strings. Binary SHA1 are treated as bytes.
* Id attribute of Commit objects is now `hexsha`, instead of `binsha`. The latter makes no sense in python 3 and I see no application of it anyway besides its artificial usage in test cases.
* **IMPORTANT**: If you were using the config_writer(), you implicitly relied on __del__ to work as expected to flush changes. To be sure changes are flushed under PY3, you will have to call the new `release()` method to trigger a flush. For some reason, __del__ is not called necessarily anymore when a symbol goes out of scope.
* The `Tree` now has a `.join('name')` method which is equivalent to `tree / 'name'`

0.3.3
=====
* When fetching, pulling or pushing, and an error occurs, it will not be reported on stdout anymore. However, if there is a fatal error, it will still result in a GitCommandError to be thrown. This goes hand in hand with improved fetch result parsing.
* Code Cleanup (in preparation for python 3 support)

  * Applied autopep8 and cleaned up code
  * Using python logging module instead of print statements to signal certain kinds of errors

0.3.2.1
=======
* `Fix for #207 <https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/207>`_

0.3.2
=====

* Release of most recent version as non-RC build, just to allow pip to install the latest version right away.
* Have a look at the milestones (https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/milestones) to see what's next.

0.3.2 RC1
=========
* **git** command wrapper

 * Added ``version_info`` property which returns a tuple of integers representing the installed git version.

 * Added GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE environment variable, which can be used to set the desired git executable to be used. despite of what would be found in the path.

* **Blob** Type

 * Added mode constants to ease the manual creation of blobs

* **IterableList**

 * Added __contains__ and __delitem__ methods

* **More Changes**

 * Configuration file parsing is more robust. It should now be able to handle everything that the git command can parse as well.
 * The progress parsing was updated to support git 1.7.0.3 and newer. Previously progress was not enabled for the git command or only worked with ssh in case of older git versions.
 * Parsing of tags was improved. Previously some parts of the name could not be parsed properly.
 * The rev-parse pure python implementation now handles branches correctly if they look like hexadecimal sha's.
 * GIT_PYTHON_TRACE is now set on class level of the Git type, previously it was a module level global variable.
 * GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE is a class level variable as well.


0.3.1 Beta 2
============
* Added **reflog support** ( reading and writing )

 * New types: ``RefLog`` and ``RefLogEntry``
 * Reflog is maintained automatically when creating references and deleting them
 * Non-intrusive changes to ``SymbolicReference``, these don't require your code to change. They allow to append messages to the reflog.

     * ``abspath`` property added, similar to ``abspath`` of Object instances
     * ``log()`` method added
     * ``log_append(...)`` method added
     * ``set_reference(...)`` method added (reflog support)
     * ``set_commit(...)`` method added (reflog support)
     * ``set_object(...)`` method added (reflog support)

 * **Intrusive Changes** to ``Head`` type

  * ``create(...)`` method now supports the reflog, but will not raise ``GitCommandError`` anymore as it is a pure python implementation now. Instead, it raises ``OSError``.

 * **Intrusive Changes** to ``Repo`` type

  * ``create_head(...)`` method does not support kwargs anymore, instead it supports a logmsg parameter

* Repo.rev_parse now supports the [ref]@{n} syntax, where *n* is the number of steps to look into the reference's past

* **BugFixes**

    * Removed incorrect ORIG_HEAD handling

* **Flattened directory** structure to make development more convenient.

 * .. note:: This alters the way projects using git-python as a submodule have to adjust their sys.path to be able to import git-python successfully.
 * Misc smaller changes and bugfixes

0.3.1 Beta 1
============
* Full Submodule-Support
* Added unicode support for author names. Commit.author.name is now unicode instead of string.
* Head Type changes

 * config_reader() & config_writer() methods added for access to head specific options.
 * tracking_branch() & set_tracking_branch() methods added for easy configuration of tracking branches.


0.3.0 Beta 2
============
* Added python 2.4 support

0.3.0 Beta 1
============
Renamed Modules
---------------
* For consistency with naming conventions used in sub-modules like gitdb, the following modules have been renamed

  * git.utils -> git.util
  * git.errors -> git.exc
  * git.objects.utils -> git.objects.util

General
-------
* Object instances, and everything derived from it, now use binary sha's internally. The 'sha' member was removed, in favor of the 'binsha' member. An 'hexsha' property is available for convenient conversions. They may only be initialized using their binary shas, reference names or revision specs are not allowed anymore.
* IndexEntry instances contained in IndexFile.entries now use binary sha's. Use the .hexsha property to obtain the hexadecimal version. The .sha property was removed to make the use of the respective sha more explicit.
* If objects are instantiated explicitly, a binary sha is required to identify the object, where previously any rev-spec could be used. The ref-spec compatible version still exists as Object.new or Repo.commit|Repo.tree respectively.
* The .data attribute was removed from the Object type, to obtain plain data, use the data_stream property instead.
* ConcurrentWriteOperation was removed, and replaced by LockedFD
* IndexFile.get_entries_key was renamed to entry_key
* IndexFile.write_tree: removed missing_ok keyword, its always True now. Instead of raising GitCommandError it raises UnmergedEntriesError. This is required as the pure-python implementation doesn't support the missing_ok keyword yet.
* diff.Diff.null_hex_sha renamed to NULL_HEX_SHA, to be conforming with the naming in the Object base class


0.2 Beta 2
===========
 * Commit objects now carry the 'encoding' information of their message. It wasn't parsed previously, and defaults to UTF-8
 * Commit.create_from_tree now uses a pure-python implementation, mimicking git-commit-tree

0.2
=====
General
-------
* file mode in Tree, Blob and Diff objects now is an int compatible to definitions
  in the stat module, allowing you to query whether individual user, group and other
  read, write and execute bits are set.
* Adjusted class hierarchy to generally allow comparison and hash for Objects and Refs
* Improved Tag object which now is a Ref that may contain a tag object with additional
  Information
* id_abbrev method has been removed as it could not assure the returned short SHA's
  where unique
* removed basename method from Objects with path's as it replicated features of os.path
* from_string and list_from_string methods are now private and were renamed to
  _from_string  and _list_from_string respectively. As part of the private API, they
  may change without prior notice.
* Renamed all find_all methods to list_items - this method is part of the Iterable interface
  that also provides a more efficients and more responsive iter_items method
* All dates, like authored_date and committer_date, are stored as seconds since epoch
  to consume less memory - they can be converted using time.gmtime in a more suitable
  presentation format if needed.
* Named method parameters changed on a wide scale to unify their use. Now git specific
  terms are used everywhere, such as "Reference" ( ref ) and "Revision" ( rev ).
  Previously multiple terms where used making it harder to know which type was allowed
  or not.
* Unified diff interface to allow easy diffing between trees, trees and index, trees
  and working tree, index and working tree, trees and index. This closely follows
  the git-diff capabilities.
* Git.execute does not take the with_raw_output option anymore. It was not used
  by anyone within the project and False by default.


Item Iteration
--------------
* Previously one would return and process multiple items as list only which can
  hurt performance and memory consumption and reduce response times.
  iter_items method provide an iterator that will return items on demand as parsed
  from a stream. This way any amount of objects can be handled.
* list_items method returns IterableList allowing to access list members by name

objects Package
----------------
* blob, tree, tag and commit module have been moved to new objects package. This should
  not affect you though unless you explicitly imported individual objects. If you just
  used the git package, names did not change.

Blob
----
* former 'name' member renamed to path as it suits the actual data better

GitCommand
-----------
* git.subcommand call scheme now prunes out None from the argument list, allowing
  to be called more comfortably as None can never be a valid to the git command
  if converted to a string.
* Renamed 'git_dir' attribute to 'working_dir' which is exactly how it is used

Commit
------
* 'count' method is not an instance method to increase its ease of use
* 'name_rev' property returns a nice name for the commit's sha

Config
------
* The git configuration can now be read and manipulated directly from within python
  using the GitConfigParser
* Repo.config_reader() returns a read-only parser
* Repo.config_writer() returns a read-write parser

Diff
----
* Members a a_commit and b_commit renamed to a_blob and b_blob - they are populated
  with Blob objects if possible
* Members a_path and b_path removed as this information is kept in the blobs
* Diffs are now returned as DiffIndex allowing to more quickly find the kind of
  diffs you are interested in

Diffing
-------
* Commit and Tree objects now support diffing natively with a common interface to
  compare against other Commits or Trees, against the working tree or against the index.

Index
-----
* A new Index class allows to read and write index files directly, and to perform
  simple two and three way merges based on an arbitrary index.

References
------------
* References are object that point to a Commit
* SymbolicReference are a pointer to a Reference Object, which itself points to a specific
  Commit
* They will dynamically retrieve their object at the time of query to assure the information
  is actual. Recently objects would be cached, hence ref object not be safely kept
  persistent.

Repo
----
* Moved blame method from Blob to repo as it appeared to belong there much more.
* active_branch method now returns a Head object instead of a string with the name
  of the active branch.
* tree method now requires a Ref instance as input and defaults to the active_branch
  instead of master
* is_dirty now takes additional arguments allowing fine-grained control about what is
  considered dirty
* Removed the following methods:

  - 'log' method as it as effectively the same as the 'commits' method
  - 'commits_since' as it is just a flag given to rev-list in Commit.iter_items
  - 'commit_count' as it was just a redirection to the respective commit method
  - 'commits_between', replaced by a note on the iter_commits method as it can achieve the same thing
  - 'commit_delta_from' as it was a very special case by comparing two different repjrelated repositories, i.e. clones, git-rev-list would be sufficient to find commits that would need to be transferred for example.
  - 'create' method which equals the 'init' method's functionality
  - 'diff' - it returned a mere string which still had to be parsed
  - 'commit_diff' - moved to Commit, Tree and Diff types respectively

* Renamed the following methods:

  - commits to iter_commits to improve the performance, adjusted signature
  - init_bare to init, implying less about the options to be used
  - fork_bare to clone, as it was to represent general clone functionality, but implied
    a bare clone to be more versatile
  - archive_tar_gz and archive_tar and replaced by archive method with different signature

* 'commits' method has no max-count of returned commits anymore, it now behaves  like git-rev-list
* The following methods and properties were added

  - 'untracked_files' property, returning all currently untracked files
  - 'head', creates a head object
  - 'tag', creates a tag object
  - 'iter_trees' method
  - 'config_reader' method
  - 'config_writer' method
  - 'bare' property, previously it was a simple attribute that could be written

* Renamed the following attributes

  - 'path' is now 'git_dir'
  - 'wd' is now 'working_dir'

* Added attribute

  - 'working_tree_dir' which may be None in case of bare repositories

Remote
------
* Added Remote object allowing easy access to remotes
* Repo.remotes lists all remotes
* Repo.remote returns a remote of the specified name if it exists

Test Framework
--------------
* Added support for common TestCase base class that provides additional functionality
  to receive repositories tests can also write to. This way, more aspects can be
  tested under real-world ( un-mocked ) conditions.

Tree
----
* former 'name' member renamed to path as it suits the actual data better
* added traverse method allowing to recursively traverse tree items
* deleted blob method
* added blobs and trees properties allowing to query the respective items in the
  tree
* now mimics behaviour of a read-only list instead of a dict to maintain order.
* content_from_string method is now private and not part of the public API anymore


0.1.6
=====

General
-------
* Added in Sphinx documentation.

* Removed ambiguity between paths and treeishs. When calling commands that
  accept treeish and path arguments and there is a path with the same name as
  a treeish git cowardly refuses to pick one and asks for the command to use
  the unambiguous syntax where '--' separates the treeish from the paths.

* ``Repo.commits``, ``Repo.commits_between``, ``Repo.commits_since``,
  ``Repo.commit_count``, ``Repo.commit``, ``Commit.count`` and
  ``Commit.find_all`` all now optionally take a path argument which
  constrains the lookup by path.  This changes the order of the positional
  arguments in ``Repo.commits`` and ``Repo.commits_since``.

Commit
------
* ``Commit.message`` now contains the full commit message (rather than just
  the first line) and a new property ``Commit.summary`` contains the first
  line of the commit message.

* Fixed a failure when trying to lookup the stats of a parentless commit from
  a bare repo.

Diff
----
* The diff parser is now far faster and also addresses a bug where
  sometimes b_mode was not set.

* Added support for parsing rename info to the diff parser. Addition of new
  properties ``Diff.renamed``, ``Diff.rename_from``, and ``Diff.rename_to``.

Head
----
* Corrected problem where branches was only returning the last path component
  instead of the entire path component following refs/heads/.

Repo
----
* Modified the gzip archive creation to use the python gzip module.

* Corrected ``commits_between`` always returning None instead of the reversed
  list.


0.1.5
=====

General
-------
* upgraded to Mock 0.4 dependency.

* Replace GitPython with git in repr() outputs.

* Fixed packaging issue caused by ez_setup.py.

Blob
----
* No longer strip newlines from Blob data.

Commit
------
* Corrected problem with git-rev-list --bisect-all. See
  http://groups.google.com/group/git-python/browse_thread/thread/aed1d5c4b31d5027

Repo
----
* Corrected problems with creating bare repositories.

* Repo.tree no longer accepts a path argument. Use:

    >>> dict(k, o for k, o in tree.items() if k in paths)

* Made daemon export a property of Repo. Now you can do this:

    >>> exported = repo.daemon_export
    >>> repo.daemon_export = True

* Allows modifying the project description. Do this:

    >>> repo.description = "Foo Bar"
    >>> repo.description
    'Foo Bar'

* Added a read-only property Repo.is_dirty which reflects the status of the
  working directory.

* Added a read-only Repo.active_branch property which returns the name of the
  currently active branch.


Tree
----
* Switched to using a dictionary for Tree contents since you will usually want
  to access them by name and order is unimportant.

* Implemented a dictionary protocol for Tree objects. The following:

    child = tree.contents['grit']

  becomes:

    child = tree['grit']

* Made Tree.content_from_string a static method.

0.1.4.1
=======

* removed ``method_missing`` stuff and replaced with a ``__getattr__``
  override in ``Git``.

0.1.4
=====

* renamed ``git_python`` to ``git``. Be sure to delete all pyc files before
  testing.

Commit
------
* Fixed problem with commit stats not working under all conditions.

Git
---
* Renamed module to cmd.

* Removed shell escaping completely.

* Added support for ``stderr``, ``stdin``, and ``with_status``.

* ``git_dir`` is now optional in the constructor for ``git.Git``.  Git now
  falls back to ``os.getcwd()`` when git_dir is not specified.

* add a ``with_exceptions`` keyword argument to git commands.
  ``GitCommandError`` is raised when the exit status is non-zero.

* add support for a ``GIT_PYTHON_TRACE`` environment variable.
  ``GIT_PYTHON_TRACE`` allows us to debug GitPython's usage of git through
  the use of an environment variable.

Tree
----
* Fixed up problem where ``name`` doesn't exist on root of tree.

Repo
----
* Corrected problem with creating bare repo.  Added ``Repo.create`` alias.

0.1.2
=====

Tree
----
* Corrected problem with ``Tree.__div__`` not working with zero length files.
  Removed ``__len__`` override and replaced with size instead. Also made size
  cache properly. This is a breaking change.

0.1.1
=====
Fixed up some urls because I'm a moron

0.1.0
=====
initial release
