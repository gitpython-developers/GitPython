CHANGES
=======
  
0.1.7
=======
This is a bugfix release and the last of its kind in 0.1.X, as 0.2.X will receive
a major redesign that will change the API.

Bugfixes
--------
* Paths in Tree objects can now handle whitespace
* Blob.blame was returning incorrect results which has been fixed.

General
-------
* The test suite now supports Mock 0.5 and above. The transition between Mock 0.4
  0.5 changed the API which required adjustments.
* Many small enhancements done to the method documentation 


0.1.6
=====

General
-------
* Added in Sphinx documentation.

* Removed ambiguity between paths and treeishs. When calling commands that
  accept treeish and path arguments and there is a path with the same name as
  a treeish git cowardly refuses to pick one and asks for the command to use
  the unambiguous syntax where '--' seperates the treeish from the paths.

* ``Repo.commits``, ``Repo.commits_between``, ``Reop.commits_since``,
  ``Repo.commit_count``, ``Repo.commit``, ``Commit.count`` and
  ``Commit.find_all`` all now optionally take a path argument which
  constrains the lookup by path.  This changes the order of the positional
  arguments in ``Repo.commits`` and ``Repo.commits_since``.

Commit
------
* ``Commit.message`` now contains the full commit message (rather than just
  the first line) and a new property ``Commit.summary`` contains the first
  line of the commit message.

* Fixed a failure when trying to lookup the stats of a parentless commit from
  a bare repo.

Diff
----
* The diff parser is now far faster and also addresses a bug where
  sometimes b_mode was not set.

* Added support for parsing rename info to the diff parser. Addition of new
  properties ``Diff.renamed``, ``Diff.rename_from``, and ``Diff.rename_to``.

Head
----
* Corrected problem where branches was only returning the last path component
  instead of the entire path component following refs/heads/.

Repo
----
* Modified the gzip archive creation to use the python gzip module.

* Corrected ``commits_between`` always returning None instead of the reversed
  list.


0.1.5
=====

General
-------
* upgraded to Mock 0.4 dependency.

* Replace GitPython with git in repr() outputs.

* Fixed packaging issue caused by ez_setup.py.

Blob
----
* No longer strip newlines from Blob data.

Commit
------
* Corrected problem with git-rev-list --bisect-all. See
  http://groups.google.com/group/git-python/browse_thread/thread/aed1d5c4b31d5027

Repo
----
* Corrected problems with creating bare repositories.

* Repo.tree no longer accepts a path argument. Use:

    >>> dict(k, o for k, o in tree.items() if k in paths)

* Made daemon export a property of Repo. Now you can do this:

    >>> exported = repo.daemon_export
    >>> repo.daemon_export = True

* Allows modifying the project description. Do this:

    >>> repo.description = "Foo Bar"
    >>> repo.description
    'Foo Bar'

* Added a read-only property Repo.is_dirty which reflects the status of the
  working directory.

* Added a read-only Repo.active_branch property which returns the name of the
  currently active branch.


Tree
----
* Switched to using a dictionary for Tree contents since you will usually want
  to access them by name and order is unimportant.

* Implemented a dictionary protocol for Tree objects. The following:

    child = tree.contents['grit']

  becomes:

    child = tree['grit']

* Made Tree.content_from_string a static method.

0.1.4.1
=======

* removed ``method_missing`` stuff and replaced with a ``__getattr__``
  override in ``Git``.

0.1.4
=====

* renamed ``git_python`` to ``git``. Be sure to delete all pyc files before
  testing.

Commit
------
* Fixed problem with commit stats not working under all conditions.

Git
---
* Renamed module to cmd.

* Removed shell escaping completely.

* Added support for ``stderr``, ``stdin``, and ``with_status``.

* ``git_dir`` is now optional in the constructor for ``git.Git``.  Git now 
  falls back to ``os.getcwd()`` when git_dir is not specified.

* add a ``with_exceptions`` keyword argument to git commands. 
  ``GitCommandError`` is raised when the exit status is non-zero.

* add support for a ``GIT_PYTHON_TRACE`` environment variable. 
  ``GIT_PYTHON_TRACE`` allows us to debug GitPython's usage of git through 
  the use of an environment variable.

Tree
----
* Fixed up problem where ``name`` doesn't exist on root of tree.

Repo
----
* Corrected problem with creating bare repo.  Added ``Repo.create`` alias.

0.1.2
=====

Tree
----
* Corrected problem with ``Tree.__div__`` not working with zero length files.  
  Removed ``__len__`` override and replaced with size instead. Also made size 
  cach properly. This is a breaking change.
